User and ccertificate -csr - certificate singing request
openssl----> csr -----> certificatesingingrequest api of k8s
##user and certificate leak+invalidate
there is no way to invalidate a certificate

###lets create a certificate+key and authenticate as user jane
###create csg

use cert+key to connect to k8s API
###########################################
create key--->create CSR--->API----download CRT from api ----use crt+key
###############################################################
##first we have to generate a key
#########################################
openssl genrsa --out jane.key 2048
####from that key we will create a certificate singing request
 openssl req -new -key jane.key -out jane.csr

  usages:
  - client auth
#####################################
##in the request filed we need to modify and provide the key generated in the last step
cat jane.csr | base64
cat jane.csr | base64 -w 0
####copy the key 
vi crt.yml
##3in the request section paste the key
 kubectl -f crt.yml create
 kubectl get csr
##this will show condtion is pending
idea is to administrator need to approve it
  102  kubectl certificate approve jane
