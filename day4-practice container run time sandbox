###we have to discuss about container run time. 
  till the contianer run time is secure k8s is secure
  Break Out of Contianer. 
  ##contianer are not contained
  Just beacuse it run in a contianer does mena it is protected
  ##lets container the linuix kernal from inside a container
  root@k8smaster:~# kubectl run pod --image=nginx
pod/pod created
root@k8smaster:~# kubectl exec pod -it bash
kubectl exec [POD] [COMMAND] is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future version. Use kubectl exec [POD] -- [COMMAND] instead.
root@pod:/# uname -r
5.15.0-1070-azure #this is the linux kerna
root@pod:/#
##from outside the container also it will show the same kernal
  root@k8smaster:~# uname -r
5.15.0-1070-azure
###the below command will show all the syscall in your system
     strace uname -r
#######if you want to hack linux kernal look for DirtyCOW famus tool to exploit linux kerna
